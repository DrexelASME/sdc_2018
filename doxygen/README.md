# ASME SDC 2018 - Formatting Style Guidelines

Formatting style that is being used for the 2018 Drexel ASME SDC robot. Doxygen is an auto-documentation generator for UNIX systems. The examples folder gives C++ and Python examples of how to properly document code to work with doxygen auto code documentation generator.

## Formatting Guidelines

Formatting rules are based on the [Google C++ Style Guidelines](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html). 

**NOTE:** **_All files should have a max character counter per line set to 120._**

#### Naming Conventions

The following table lays out the naming convention used for all files. 

Object | Example
--- | ---
Variables | underscore_variable_names
Constants | CONSTANTS_ALL_CAPS
Defines | DEFINES_ALL_CAPS
Floats | 1.0 (add period for whole numbers)
Functions | camelCaseFunctions
Classes | CamelCaseClasses
Namespaces | underscore_namespace_names
Files | underscore_file_names

#### Function Inputs

Function inputs should use the convention shown below. Function inputs that are not modified should be passed by reference while function inputs that are modified in the function (modification remains after function call) should be passed in as a pointer. An example is shown below the table.

Object | Pointer Type
--- | ---
Unmodified Function Inputs | Pass by Reference
Modified Function Inputs | Pointers

```cpp
void namespace_name::myFunction(int &input, int *output) {
	*output = input;
}
```

#### Header Guards

Header guards should be used on all header files. Below is an example of how to use a header guard.

```cpp
#ifndef FILE_NAME_H_
#define FILE_NAME_H_

// Code goes here

#endif /* FILE_NAME_H_ */
```

#### Commenting

Commenting should only be done if a the opertation of a section or line of code is not obvious to a reader. In most cases, variable names and using proper white spacing should provide the user with enough information to understand each section and line of code without a comment.
